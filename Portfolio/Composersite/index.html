            <p>I am a musician, educator, and composer.Hi! I'm Kyle. I am a composer of new music, as well as an arranger, educator, and musician.  I recently earned a master's degree in music theory and composition from Ball State University. Now, I'm teaching middle school band and orchestra in Aurora, Colorado.  My music has been performed across the United States, and ranges from art song, to marching band arrangements, to electroacoustic works and film scores.  In my works, I seek that elusive balance between accessibility and experimentation.</p>

            <p>An all-inclusive philosophy informs my perspective, and I draw from quality music of all times and places for inspiration and guidance.  As an educator, I challenges students to find their own voices, while fostering an appreciation for those of others.</p>
        
            <p>I earned bachelor's degrees in music education and instrumental performance from the University of Northern Colorado, where I also studied composition with Paul Elwood.  At Ball State, I studied with Jody Nagel, Eleanor Trawick, and Derek Johnson. I have worked as a band director, as well as staff for multiple competitive marching bands in Colorado.  As a euphoniumist and trombonist, I have performed with the Lakewood Symphony, the Colorado Wind Ensemble, and the US Air Force Academy Band, in addition to numerous collegiate ensembles.</p>
